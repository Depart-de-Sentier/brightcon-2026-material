You are helping rebuild an aggregated life-cycle-inventory dataset as a unit process.

The dataset `{{target_name}}` [{{target_location}}], reference unit 1 {{target_unit}}, is shipped in the BAFU-2026 database as a "system terminated" inventory: it has no technosphere inputs, only ~{{n_flows}} cumulative elementary flows. A public report documents the underlying process. Your job is to read the report excerpt and produce the *unit process* as line items — what the process consumes from other datasets and what it emits directly — each traceable to the excerpt.

## What the database says about the dataset

- BAFU category: {{target_category}}
- includedProcesses: {{included_processes}}
- technology: {{technology}}
- generalComment: {{general_comment}}
- source cited in the metadata: {{source}}
- time period: {{time_period}}

## Direct resource flows visible in the aggregated vector

These flows appear in the aggregated inventory with amounts that no upstream dataset would plausibly emit on this dataset's behalf; they are candidates for the process's own direct resource flows (per 1 {{target_unit}}):
{{direct_candidates}}

## Report excerpt

Source file: `{{evidence_file}}` (SHA-256 {{evidence_sha256}}), pages {{evidence_pages}} of `{{report_name}}`.

## Rules

1. Every line item must quote the exact line of the excerpt it comes from (`quote`), with the raw value and raw unit as printed. Never invent a value. If the excerpt gives a range, report the range as `raw_min`/`raw_max` and put your point estimate in `raw_value`.
2. Report values per the excerpt's own basis (`per`, e.g. "per t burnt shale", "per m2 board"); do not convert. State the reference basis you found in `basis` so the code can scale to 1 {{target_unit}}.
3. If a value needs a physical conversion (litres of diesel to MJ, m3 of water to kg), give `factor`, `factor_unit` and `factor_source` (a standard value with its source, e.g. "diesel 0.84 kg/l × 42.8 MJ/kg = 36 MJ/l, ecoinvent convention"). Leave `factor` at 1 otherwise.
4. Classify each line: `kind` = "input" (a product or service from another dataset), "emission" (a direct release to air/water/soil), "resource" (a direct extraction from nature), "product" (the reference product), "co-product" or "ignore" (with a reason).
5. Propose a `search` phrase (2–4 words) that a name search in a life-cycle database would use: for inputs the supplying dataset in ecoinvent-2 naming style ("diesel burned building machine", "sodium hydroxide production mix"); for emissions and resources the substance in EF 3.1 / ecoinvent nomenclature ("particles PM10" for dust, "nitrogen oxides", "carbon dioxide fossil", "crude oil", "water"). Do not guess the exact name; the search is resolved by code afterwards.
6. If the excerpt describes allocation (e.g. an economic allocation between co-products), record it in `allocation` and use the allocated column when the table has one. If it states that the composition items add up to a mass ("adds up to 1.00 kg"), put that mass per basis in `mass_sum`, else null.
7. Mark anything you are unsure about with `confidence` = "low" and say why in `note`. Do not omit uncertain items; the reviewer decides.
8. Do not add inputs the excerpt does not mention, even if you know the process needs them. Missing items are reported in `gaps` instead.

Return only the JSON object described by the schema.
